# Revision history for `indexed`

## 0.2.0 -- YYYY-mm-dd

* Drop support for GHC before 8.6, to allow use of `-XQuantifiedConstraints`
    * Drop Haskell98-only restriction while we're at it, allowing us to merge in `indexed-extras`.
* (Almost) completely rewrite library to bring it up to date with the post AMP and MFP world.
